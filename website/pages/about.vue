            Humanity Deck was born out of the frustration with other Cards
            Against Humanity websites which are super clunky and frustrating to
            play with, often riddled with full servers or laggy gameplay. The
            whole point of this site is to provide a slick CAH gaming
            experience, using the most modern technologies available today.
