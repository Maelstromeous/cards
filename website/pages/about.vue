              <span class="text-center">Humanity Deck was born out of the frustration with other Cards Against Humanity websites which are super clunky and frustrating to play with, often riddled with full servers or laggy gameplay. The whole point of this site is to provide a slick CAH gaming experience, using the most modern technologies available today.</span>
